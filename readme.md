# ShareDrive Project

## Overview

**ShareDrive** is a file-sharing application that allows users to upload, share, update, and delete files. The project is developed using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. MySQL is used to store file metadata and user information, while files are stored on a local server. The backend is protected using Spring Security to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to protect user data and restrict access to the application.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload files and folders to the system.
- **File Download**: Users can download their uploaded files.
- **File Update**: Users can update existing files.
- **File Deletion**: Users can delete files they no longer need.
- **File Sharing**: Users can share files with other users by providing them access.
- **File Management**: Users can view and manage all their uploaded files in an explorer-like interface.
